NAME
====

Pod::Tangle - Tangle code from Raku source

SYNOPSIS
========

Installation (assuming you already have [Raku](ttps://raku.org/downloads) and [zef](https://github.com/ugexe/zef) installed):

```sh
zef install Pod::Tangle
```

You can use Pod::Tangle as a library:

```raku
use Pod::Tangle
tangle($filename.IO);
```

You can also use it through it's command line tool

```sh
pod-tangle $source.raku > $source-without-pod.raku
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

Pod::Tangle strips all Pod documentation from a Raku source file, leaving it as a "tangled" file. The goal of doing so is to support basic [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) in Raku.
